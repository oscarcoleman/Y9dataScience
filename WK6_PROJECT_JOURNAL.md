# Project Journal
This is my journal for my personal project starting in Week 6
### Examples of Good Questions
- How does the average age of gold medalists compare to that of participants?
- What are the top 5 sports, by gold medals, for male and female athletes respectively?
- What are the top 5 countries, in gold medals won, in the periods 1950-1970 and 2000-2020?
## My project purpose and audience
### Title
How did the olympic gold medal counts, by country, change between the periods 1952-1972 and 2000-2020?
### Project Statement
In the 1952 Olympics, held in Helsinki, there were 69 participatory countries, while in the 2020 Olympics, held in Tokyo, there were 206 participatory countries. By analysing the leading countries in the period 1952-1972 compared to that of 2000-2020, the aim is to outline how expanded accessibility has influenced the dominating countries. I will not be including East Germany or the USSR, as they have not been in the Olympics during the 2000-2020 period.
### Intended Audience
Olympics fans and anyone interested in who's done best in which periods.
## Project Functional Requirements
- The program will filter participants for gold medalists and group them into countries, during the periods 1952-1972 and 2000-2020.
- I will apply a filter and visualise using two seperate bar graphs.
## Project Non-Functional Requirements
- The project will be presentated simply and as such easy to interpret.
