# Y9dataScience

All work, including questions, in this markdown file is sourced from the following: https://vormamim-web-programming.gitbook.io/hsc-software-engineering/pandas-for-data-science/week-3/filtering-sorting-and-grouping 

## Week 1
### 23/5
Worked on Activities A, in Google Classroom, learned about data science basics.

## Week 2
### Monday 26/5
I installed pandas on VS code, and ran the following code:
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("athlete_events.csv")

print(df.head())

# Show the column names
print(df.columns)
```
